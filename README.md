# mineworldremote
Create Minecraft worlds remotely.

to begin go to program cosmetics
then press 0 and enter
then input the file location of the directory you want to create the world to (your minecraft world folder)
then input the name of the source folder (the thing you downloaded, by default mineworldremote)
***REMEMBER TO PUT THE FULL FILE NAME FOR BOTH OF THESE! EG. C:\NAME\STUFF\MINEWORLDREMOTE***
then press enter and let it do the rest of the work for you.
This is in early alpha and is nothing fancy, do not expect much.
